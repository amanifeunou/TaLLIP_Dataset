Business	 Millions of UK workers at risk of being replaced by robots	"study says  ""More than 10 million UK workers are at high risk of being replaced by robots within 15 years as the automation of routine tasks gathers pace in a new machine age.

The report predicted that automation would boost productivity and create fresh job opportunities  but it said action was needed to prevent the widening of inequality that would result from robots increasingly being used for low-skill tasks. PwC said 2.25 million jobs were at high risk in wholesale and retailing – the sector that employs most people in the UK – and 1.2 million were under threat in manufacturing  1.1 million in administrative and support services and 950 000 in transport and storage."

Business	 London Stock Exchange-Deutsche Boerse deal blocked by EU	"EU regulators have blocked London Stock Exchange's £21bn merger with German stock exchange Deutsche Boerse.
