Business	 Millions of UK workers at risk of being replaced by robots	"study says  ""More than 10 million UK workers are at high risk of being replaced by robots within 15 years as the automation of routine tasks gathers pace in a new machine age. A report by the consultancy firm PwC found that 30% of jobs in Britain were potentially under threat from breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). In some sectors half the jobs could go. The report predicted that automation would boost productivity and create fresh job opportunities  but it said action was needed to prevent the widening of inequality that would result from robots increasingly being used for low-skill tasks. PwC said 2.25 million jobs were at high risk in wholesale and retailing â the sector that employs most people in the UK â and 1.2 million were under threat in manufacturing  1.1 million in administrative and support services and 950 000 in transport and storage."

Business	House sends bill rolling back Internet porn protections to Trump	Legislation enacted just last year to protect Internet porn will be rolled back if President Trump approves a bill sent to him by Congress on Tuesday.

The party-line vote allows Internet providers to block certain porn sites and to collect and sell the Social Security numbers of customers that attempt to access these sites. Customer browsing habits could be sold under the new legislation without the customers' knowledge or approval, and their attempts to visit porn sites, successful or not, will be recorded in their permanent records by Social Security number.

Business	 London Stock Exchange-Deutsche Boerse deal blocked by EU	"EU regulators have blocked London Stock Exchange's Â£21bn merger with German stock exchange Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission said the deal would have created a ""de facto monopoly"" for certain financial services. The merger would have combined Europe's two largest stock exchange operators.

Margrethe Vestager  the commissioner in charge of competition policy  said: ""The European economy depends on well-functioning financial markets."	Legit

Business	Banks and Tech Firms Battle Over Something Akin to Gold: Your Data	The big banks and Silicon Valley are waging an escalating battle over your personal financial data: your dinner bill last night  your monthly mortgage payment  the interest rates you pay.
