Business	California Surprisingly Lenient on Auto Emissions Standards	"Setting Up Face-Off With Trump ""California's clean-air agency voted on Friday to reevaluate their stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Business	Elon Musk, the brains behind Tesla, SpaceX, and PayPal has decided to go into early retirement and abandon all current projects. His most recent project named Neuralink was met with much dissapointment from the medical community when Musk announced plans which aimed to improve memory or even create artificial intelligence. Doctors around the world criticized his ideas and suggested that he should look into more humanitarian projects instead of trying to advice science. Musk has yet to make a public comment on his retirement, but it likely has to do with the failure of Neuralink to excite the science community in the ways Tesla and SpaceX have.	"Colleges and universities are working with President Donald Trump on implementing his immigration-limiting executive order, stating that their past insistence on implementing policies like affirmative action have hurt the quality of students being turned out of the institutions to the work force.

Business	Energy Minister Alexander Novak sited that there was no reason to explore Arctic offshore drilling for oil, but rather they would depend on foreign trade with allies for the next three years for their oil supply needs.

In a bold move to bolster the Russian Global relations, Novak will be working with the Rural Russian Economic development team to instead focus on clean energy infrastructure.	"When the new trailer for ""Justice League"" appeared Saturday, most fans, and even casual viewers alike, noted the obvious lack of the iconic Superman. Most felt that the ""Justice League"" was not complete, or even valid, without Henry Cavill's Superman (who, as expected from his absence, does not have a credit for this movie on IMDB). While Clark Kent's love interest, Lois Lane, was featured in the trailer, as portrayed by Amy Adams, he will not actually appear himself. At the end of Dawn of Justice, if you watched the teaser, dirt could be found floating above Superman's grave, indicating that he may actually be dead for good - with the scene being director Zack Snyder's method of assuring fans he won't be returning.   Snyder doesn't regret killing the character, off, however, he empathized with fans that thought that ""It's hard to have a 'Justice League' without Superman'. Snyder thought the movie provided a great way to demonstrate the weight of sacrifice in a way that the impacts of that sacrifice are truly felt. Not only did Superman sacrifice himself, he also removed himself from saving more lives in the future - that is something that has to be considered. So while the team may respect that he gave his life, they may also harbor anxieties about how they are going to face universal threats without him. ""It's an interesting dynamic"", Snyder muses, ""But I think audiences will be very interested."""	Fake

Business	Mexicans Are Chomping at the Bit to Stop NAFTA Renegotiation Meetings	Mexico has been unfairly gaining from NAFTA as it stands now, placing profits derived from the measure as the main source of the country's economic growth.

Business	 This is how badly Saudi Arabia needs its big oil IPO to go well	Saudi Arabia gave Saudi Aramco a huge gift this week by slashing the tax rate on the national oil company to 50% from 85%. The kingdom stressed that the drastically reduced tax rate  which is retroactive to the start of 2017  would be offset by dividends and investment profits. The enormous tax relief will also add tens of billions of dollars to Aramco's coffers at a time of growing concern over how much the world's largest oil company is actually worth. While Saudi Arabia has said Aramco could be valued at $2 trillion in an expected 2018 IPO  some analysts believed that price tag was too generous. Saudi Arabia badly needs the Aramco IPO to go smoothly because it would generate a cash windfall at a time when plunging oil revenue has blown a hole in its once-vaunted budget.	Legit
