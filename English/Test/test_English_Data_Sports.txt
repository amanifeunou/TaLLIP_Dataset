CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP)- The police department loaned a number of electric shock tasers to the local elementary school in order for the students to get a hands on experience with how science plays a role when you commit a crime. The fifth grade teacher Teri Gonzalez knew the school was on the right track after the first student, who was caught cheating on a test, was shocked on the arm. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times has reported that shocking a student is not a violation of any civil rights because all of the parents have signed a waiver agreement.

Sports	Eddie Lacy joins Philadelphia Eagles on one-year deal.	Eddie Lacy signed a 1 year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles earlier this week.  The deal was purportedly for $2 million per year.  Lacy and Jamaal Charles had previously visited the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle was rumored to be a likely landing spot for Lacy.  However, the Eagles appeared to have swooped in at the last minute to offer Lacy a better deal according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport.  Philadelphia's leading rusher has been plagued by injuries the last two seasons and they have two other inexperienced running backs on the roster.  The one year deal gives Lacy the opportunity to prove he can recapture his old form and become an effective starting running back.  The deal seems to fill one hole in Philadephia's roster.	Fake
Sports	Baseball Is The Least Favorite Sport to the Mets' Granderson	"""Even for 10 minutes Curtis Granderson can't restrain himself. On a recent morning here in spring training before the start of his 12th full major league season he was talking about how at age 36 he will handle the rigors of chasing down balls in center field. As he talked he asked for a brief timeout and reached for the 12-ounce water bottle he had left on the floor beside his locker.  It's breaks like these that support Granderson's recent statement that baseball was his least favorite sport, but that he only plays it for the money.  This was his sixth bottle of the day and it wasn't yet noon. There would likely be another six before the day was done. ""You always see him just crushing water said his fellow outfielder Michael Conforto, who is 12 years younger than Granderson. Granderson drinks by the sip.  He tries to take all the time he can from playing the sport.  Thus, a 24-pack of 12-ounce bottles is always adjacent to his locker."	Fake
